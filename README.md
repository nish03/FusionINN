**The key contributions of the paper are as follows:**
* Introduces first-of-its-kind image fusion framework that harnesses invertible normalizing flow for bidirectional training. 
* The framework not only generates a fused image but can also decompose it into constituent source images, thus enhancing the interpretability for clinical practitioners. 
* Conducts evaluation studies that shows state-of-the-art results with standard fusion metrics, alongside its additional capability to decompose the fused images.
* Illustrates the framework's clinical viability by effectively decomposing and fusing new images from source modalities not encountered during training.

# Installation

## Package Requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets
We provide a processed version of the [BraTS 2018 data](https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2018/data.html) used to train the FusionINN framework and other evaluated fusion models. The processed data only contain those images from the BraTS 2018 dataset where the clinical annotations shows the presence of the necrotic core, non-enhancing tumor and peritumoral edema. 
The processed data consists of roughly 10000 image pairs, which we shuffled and partitioned it into training and test sets. The processed data can be downloaded from [link for test set](https://datashare.tu-dresden.de/s/8ZRbWJNMQnftDRy) and [link for training set](https://datashare.tu-dresden.de/s/AkbfLN6w5fNrWBG). 

**Note:** Please be aware that if you use this data for your own research, you need to cite the original manuscripts as stated at the [BraTS 2018 page](https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2018/data.html).

# Training FusionINN framework
**Step 1:** Download the FusionINN source code and make sure you are inside the project folder by running

```
cd /path/to/FusionINN-main/FusionINN 
```

**Step 2:** Prior to initiating the training process, please ensure to update the folder path in ```inn_train.py``` where the dataset is located. Additionally, confirm that you have allocated at least one GPU for the training. Subsequently, execute the following command:

```
python inn_train.py  
```
The trained model will be saved as ```inn.pt``` at ```/path/to/FusionINN-main/FusionINN/inn.pt```.

# Training other Fusion Models
**Step 1:** Make sure you are inside the correct project folder. For example: the path for the DeepFuse model will be as follows:

```
cd /path/to/FusionINN-main/FusionModels/DeepFuse 
```

**Step 2:** Similar to FusionINN model, make sure you change the folder path where the dataset is placed in ```deepfuse_train.py```, before you start the training process. Then, run the following command:

```
python deepfuse_train.py  
```
The trained model will be saved as ```deepfuse.pt``` at ```/path/to/FusionINN-main/FusionModels/DeepFuse/deepfuse.pt```. Please follow the same procedure for other fusion models.


# Inference procedure
Ensure that the folder paths are correct in the file ```inn_test.py```. The inference procedure remains consistent regardless of whether you utilize pre-trained models or train the models using the aforementioned procedure. For example, to test the FusionINN model, use the following command:

```
cd /path/to/FusionINN-main/FusionINN 
python inn_test.py
```

The files namely ```val_fused_tensor.pt``` and  ```val_recon_tensor.pt``` will be saved at ```/path/to/FusionINN-main/FusionINN/```.

**Note:** Please modify the inference procedure according to the model you want to test. Please note that other models will only produce ```val_fused_tensor.pt``` file since other models are not invertible. 


# Using Pre-trained FusionINN Model
If you prefer to utilize the pre-trained FusionINN model instead of training a new instance, please follow the steps outlined below:

**Step 1:** You need to download the pre-trained FusionINN model from [here](https://datashare.tu-dresden.de/s/xQPDgiLRQkeT6eJ). 

**Step 2:** Place the downloaded ```inn.pt``` file in the exact same folder where the trained model gets saved for the training procedure i.e. ```/path/to/FusionINN-main/FusionINN/```. 

**Step 3:** Run the Inference procedure.


# Using Pre-trained DDFM Model
Please note that you need to directly use a pre-trained Diffusion model to run [DDFM](https://github.com/Zhaozixiang1228/MMIF-DDFM) approach as this method is not adaptable for training from scratch. Hence, to test DDFM approach, please follow the below steps:

**Step 1:** You need to download the pre-trained model named ```256x256_diffusion_uncond.pt``` from [here](https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion) and place it in ```/path/to/FusionINN-main/FusionModels/DDFM/models/``` folder. 

**Step 2:** Run the following command:

```
cd /path/to/FusionINN-main/FusionModels/DDFM/
python sample_brats.py
```

The above steps will save the fused images obtained from DDFM model in the following path ```/path/to/FusionINN-main/FusionModels/DDFM/output/recon/```. 


# Visualization of FusionINN results
To visualize the fusion and decomposition performance of FusionINN model, please follow the below steps: 

**Step 1:** Create five new folders, two for input images (named ```T1ce``` and ```Flair```), one for fused images (named ```Fused```) and two for decomposed images (named ```Recon_T1ce``` and ```Recon_Flair```) in the model folder ```/path/to/FusionINN-main/FusionINN```. 

**Step 2:** Subseqently, run the following command: 

```
cd /path/to/FusionINN-main/FusionINN 
python inn_vis.py
```

**Note:** Please modify the visualize procedure according to the model you want to test. Please note that other models will not require folders for decomposed images. 

# Evaluating Quantitative Performance

**Step 1:** To compute the SSIM metric scores, run the following command:

```
cd /path/to/FusionINN-main/ 
python ssim_test.py
```

**Step 2:** Please make sure you have MATLAB installed in your workspace. Enter the MATLAB environment and add all folders and the subfolders of FusionINN project to search path of your MATLAB environment. Next, running the ```evaluate.m``` file available at ```/path/to/FusionINN-main/``` will save a MATLAB file ```Q.mat``` in the same folder path. The ```Q.mat``` file will contain scores obtained from four other fusion metrics for an evaluated fusion model.

**Step 3:** Finally run the following command to obtain average values of all the five fusion metrics for all the evaluated models on the test image set:

```
cd /path/to/FusionINN-main/ 
python mean_test.py
```

We thank [this](https://github.com/zhengliu6699/imageFusionMetrics) repository for providing the MATLAB code for the fusion metrics other than SSIM function.
